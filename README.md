# TariffHunter

**An AI-powered tool that identifies products at risk of U.S. tariffs and helps businesses pivot sourcing strategies before supply chain disruptions hit.**

TariffHunter scans product data (e.g., from Amazon listings or bulk CSVs), classifies items as "China-sourced" or "tariff-vulnerable," and suggests alternative sourcing regions using LLMs and keyword intelligence.
